      A version control system allows an app or web developer have a full view of their project's history. All the
      changes that were made along the way, when they were made, and who made them are tracked by creating a
      chronological timeline of the project's development process.
      <br>
      <br>

      A benefit of version control is making it possible for one or multiple people work on a project without
      interfering with each other's work. It's done by creating multiple branches or features so changes can be tested
      and made without breaking the live, original or earlier version of the file. If an unwanted change was pushed to
      the main branch, recovery of the earlier version is still possible.
      <br>
      <br>
      One of the most well known and commonly used application of version control today is Git, which was developed by
      the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds.
